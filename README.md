Welcome to my OpenClassrooms Project 5.

Project description: the goal is to develop a professional blog.

Install the project: download the archive and unzip it in the 'www' directory of Wamp (or another server) and modify the `config/db.php` file to match your configuration.

The database is in the `/bdd` folder and is named `blog`.

To start the project create a virtual host that points to `/public/index.php`.

The database is in the / bdd folder and is named "blog".

To start the project create a virtualhost that points to the folder /public/index.php

To finish I use the sendgrid feature for email sending, so that it works you will have to modify the /config/mail.php file."

For email sending the project uses SendGrid; edit the `/config/mail.php` file to configure it.
