"Hello,

You are on my project 5 openclassrooms.

Project Description: The project is therefore to develop your professional blog.

Install the project: Download the archive and unzip it in the directory 'www' of Wamp (or other), and modify the file config / db.php and adapt it to your configuration.

The database is in the / bdd folder and is named "blog".

To start the project create a virtualhost that points to the folder /public/index.php

To finish I use the sendgrid feature for email sending, so that it works you will have to modify the /config/mail.php file."
